# Blueprint for Audiobook Player UI

This document outlines the logical structure and components required to build a modular audiobook player UI feature in Flutter. It assumes that a `theme.dart` file and a backend audio handler service are already available.

## 1. Required File Structure

Organize the UI components into the following directory structure within `lib/`:

```
lib/
└── features/
    └── audio_player/
        ├── screens/
        │   └── player_screen.dart
        └── widgets/
            ├── artwork_widget.dart
            ├── control_buttons.dart
            ├── progress_bar.dart
            └── title_widget.dart
```

## 2. Widget Blueprints

### 2.1. `artwork_widget.dart`

**Purpose**: To display the audiobook's cover art.

**Logic & States**:
*   **Input**: This widget receives the current `MediaItem` from its parent.
*   **Primary State**:
    *   If the `mediaItem` contains a valid `artUri`, display the image from that network URL.
    *   The image should be clipped with rounded corners (e.g., 16px radius).
    *   It should have a subtle drop shadow for depth.
*   **Loading State**:
    *   While the network image is loading, display a `CircularProgressIndicator`.
*   **Fallback State**:
    *   If the `mediaItem` is null or has no `artUri`, display a placeholder container with a generic icon (e.g., `Icons.book`).
*   **Error State**:
    *   If the network image fails to load, display an error icon.

**Backend Interaction**:
*   `// Needs: mediaItem.artUri (from the audio handler's mediaItem stream)`

---

### 2.2. `title_widget.dart`

**Purpose**: To display the title of the current chapter and the author's name.

**Logic & States**:
*   **Input**: This widget receives the current `MediaItem` from its parent.
*   **Layout**: A vertical `Column`.
*   **Component 1 (Title)**: A `Text` widget for the title.
    *   Style: Large, bold font.
    *   **Fallback State**: If `mediaItem` or its title is null, display placeholder text like "Loading title...".
*   **Component 2 (Artist/Author)**: A `Text` widget for the artist/author.
    *   Style: Smaller, less prominent font color.
    *   **Fallback State**: If `mediaItem` or its artist is null, display "Loading author...".

**Backend Interaction**:
*   `// Needs: mediaItem.title (from the audio handler's mediaItem stream)`
*   `// Needs: mediaItem.artist (from the audio handler's mediaItem stream)`

---

### 2.3. `progress_bar.dart`

**Purpose**: To visualize and control the playback progress.

**Logic & States**:
*   **Input**: This widget needs access to the main `audioHandler` instance.
*   **Data Combination**: To function correctly, this widget needs to listen to and combine three separate streams from the audio handler:
    1.  The current playback position.
    2.  The buffered position.
    3.  The total duration of the current media item.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   **Progress Bar**: Shows the elapsed time.
    *   **Buffered Bar**: Shows how much of the audio has been downloaded.
    *   **Thumb**: A draggable circle that indicates the current position.
    *   **Time Labels**: Text labels for the current time (e.g., `01:23`) and total duration (e.g., `24:15`).
*   **User Interaction**:
    *   When the user drags the thumb or taps on the bar, it should trigger a `seek` event.

**Backend Interaction**:
*   `// Needs: stream of current playback position (from AudioService.position)`
*   `// Needs: stream of buffered position (from audioHandler.playbackState)`
*   `// Needs: stream of total duration (from audioHandler.mediaItem)`
*   `// Action: onSeek(newPosition) should call audioHandler.seek(newPosition)`

### 2.4. `control_buttons.dart`

**Purpose**: To provide the main playback controls.

**Logic & States**:
*   **Input**: This widget needs the main `audioHandler` and the latest `PlaybackState`.
*   **Layout**: A horizontal `Row` with three `IconButton` widgets.
*   **Button 1 (Skip to Previous)**:
    *   Icon: `Icons.skip_previous`.
    *   Action: When pressed, calls the "skip to previous" method on the audio handler.
*   **Button 2 (Play/Pause)**:
    *   This is a stateful button.
    *   **Icon Logic**:
        *   If the backend state is `playing`, show a `pause` icon (e.g., `Icons.pause_circle_filled`).
        *   If the backend state is `not playing`, show a `play` icon (e.g., `Icons.play_circle_filled`).
    *   **Action Logic**:
        *   If `playing`, `onPressed` calls the `pause` method on the audio handler.
        *   If `not playing`, `onPressed` calls the `play` method on the audio handler.
*   **Button 3 (Skip to Next)**:
    *   Icon: `Icons.skip_next`.
    *   Action: When pressed, calls the "skip to next" method on the audio handler.
*   **Loading State**:
    *   If the backend's `processingState` is `loading` or `buffering`, replace the entire `Row` of buttons with a single `CircularProgressIndicator`. This provides clear feedback to the user.

**Backend Interaction**:
*   `// Needs: playbackState.playing (to determine play/pause icon)`
*   `// Needs: playbackState.processingState (to determine loading state)`
*   `// Action: onPressed should call audioHandler.skipToPrevious()`
*   `// Action: onPressed should call audioHandler.play()`
*   `// Action: onPressed should call audioHandler.pause()`
*   `// Action: onPressed should call audioHandler.skipToNext()`

## 3. Screen Assembly

### `player_screen.dart`

**Purpose**: To assemble all the UI widgets into a single, cohesive screen.

**Logic & Structure**:
1.  **Top-Level State Management**: The screen's root widget should be a `StreamBuilder`.
    *   This `StreamBuilder` listens to the necessary streams from the `audioHandler` (specifically `mediaItem` and `playbackState`). This is efficient as it rebuilds the UI in one place and passes the data down to the child widgets.
2.  **Layout**: The body of the `Scaffold` will be a `Column`. Use `Spacer` widgets or `MainAxisAlignment` to distribute the components vertically.
3.  **Component Assembly**: The `Column`'s children will be instances of our widgets, in the following order:
    *   `Spacer`
    *   `ArtworkWidget` (receives the `mediaItem` from the `StreamBuilder`)
    *   `SizedBox` (for spacing)
    *   `TitleWidget` (receives the `mediaItem` from the `StreamBuilder`)
    *   `SizedBox` (for spacing)
    *   `ProgressBarWidget` (receives the `audioHandler` instance)
    *   `SizedBox` (for spacing)
    *   `ControlButtons` (receives the `audioHandler` and `playbackState` from the `StreamBuilder`)
    *   `Spacer`
4.  **Data Flow**: The `PlayerScreen` is the "smart" container that gets data from the backend and passes it down to the "dumb" presentation widgets.

**Backend Interaction**:
*   `// Needs: to be given an instance of the main audioHandler service upon creation.`
*   `// Needs: a StreamBuilder listening to audioHandler.mediaItem and audioHandler.playbackState.`
